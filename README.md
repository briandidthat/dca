# DCA

This project demonstrates a vault contract that facilitates the creation and execution of trading strategies on Ethereum using 0x protocol. Users can deploy a vault that will accept ERC20 tokens for swapping manually or via strategies.

You will need to visit [Ox API](https://0x.org) to generate a token for enabling swap quote requests
